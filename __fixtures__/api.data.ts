Has claims if he runs up to expectations. DESTROYING (5) goes very well this course and distance starting 19 times for seven wins and five minors. Was out of the placings last time (30.47) at this track in a Grade 4/5, finishing fourth and beaten 9 lengths. Makes strong appeal on best. PLAYER ONE (3) missed the hat-trick last start when third and beaten 3.5 lengths (22.79) last time at Richmond. Has a good record here at this journey. Leading player again.

            "TITAN RISING (5) just missed two back but made amends last start when getting the job done over 2000m last time out. Wheately replaces the apprentice hoop this time and he maps to find the front once again. Can dictate the tempo and be tough to catch once again. RAZMAS (4)  missed last start after a good win two back over the mile. Up in trip now for the first time, but he has shown good early speed in recent efforts. Can be prominent from the outset and a forward showing is on the cards. WIFE SAYS YES (13) finished off nicely behind TITAN RISING last time out and may be able to sit closer from an inside draw this time around. She jumped favourite on that occasion and while it has been a while between drinks, her last start showed she's on the cusp. HEAVENBENT (8) can be in the finish stepping out in trip for the first time. KIRRILY (10) is likely to get back from the draw but can be flying home late in the race.",
